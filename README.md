# Project: Real-Time Face Recognition and Attendance Tracker System.

This project is a real-time face recognition and attendance tracking system developed using Python and OpenCV. The system captures facial images using a webcam and identifies individuals in real-time to mark attendance automatically. Key libraries and packages used include:

**• OpenCV (cv2)** for image processing and facial recognition.
**• NumPy** for efficient data manipulation.
**• OS** for managing system file operations.
**• Pickle** for storing and loading trained face recognition models.
The system registers new faces, matches them with existing data, and logs attendance, providing an automated solution for classroom or workplace environments.
